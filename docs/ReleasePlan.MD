### ***Rollout overview***

In today’s software world, technology continues to change and evolve at a rapid pace thus the challenge of keeping up with these changes. There is an urgent need to be aware of security regulations, omni-channel systems, and mobile device advancement.

In addition to these concerns, We need to ensure what we are working with is up to date, which will make sure the latest evolvement concerns are addressed and the newest functionality is available. However, before rolling out software updates to you, you’ll need to take the following considerations into account:

***Compatibility and Support***
> Customers will need to ensure that their systems will be able to accommodate the requirements of the software. They will need to address the following areas:
> 
> Hardware compatibility
Operation system version
Anti-virus software compatibility
Network connectivity
Wireless security

It will be our responsibility to ensure that during software rollouts, support staff has to be considered. Incase of a need for additional staffing for the implementation and post-implementation period to address any issues or In the longer term, there may be implications to productivity that should be considered, so we'll need to monitor staff levels and plan accordingly.

***Mobile Devices Platforms***

>We will not overlook Mobile devices and there operating systems when conducting a software rollout. Even if the application contained on the mobile devices you use is not impacted by the software being deployed, changes to the network infrastructure might impact them. We will not rely exclusively on connectivity testing of the prototype on a single mobile software operating system Instead, pilot test changes by the customers on all mobile platforms before deploying to identify any issues that may not have been considered during the planning and development process.
